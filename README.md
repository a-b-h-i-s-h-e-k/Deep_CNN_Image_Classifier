# Prerequisites
- To effectively run this notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Ensure you have a Jupyter environment ready, such as Anaconda or Jupyter Lab.

# Setup
- Download the notebook and associated data files to your machine.
- Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already:
      - pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow
- Launch the notebook in your Jupyter environment.

# Running the Notebook
- Follow these steps within your Jupyter environment:
